Title Of Project:
Employee details form

Description: 
In this project a simple form has been created in html which takes details of each employee like id, name and email as input and store it in the cloud jsonpower database. By using ajax/jquery we are validating the form such that no field will be empty. This function is also converting these values to json string to store these in the database that will be created.

Database created-EMPLOYEE
Relation created-EMP-REL


Another function is saveEmployee() which is basically generating a put request with the data entered to push it onto the database. It is using the token generated by my id so that the visualization is visible on my dashboard. We have a javascript library jpdb-commons.js that is used to create requests and do ajax calls and it is being used to do the action which was earlier being done by putrequest and executecommand functions respectively.

Third is the page reset function which is being used to reset the form after each put request to avoid redundancy of information in the database.
